## This repository contains my contribution to an ongoing research study by Temple University's Collaborative on Community Inclusion. 
<ul>
   <li>The study uses GPS tracking to measure the mobility and community involvement of people with serious mental illnesses.</li>

   <li>I contributed to the effort by writing an R script which reduced the data processing time from hours to minutes.</li>
       <ul>
         <li>The R script I wrote removes outliers, imputes missing data points, and clusters data points based on time and location.</li>
         <li>The R script was later <a href="http://www.tucollaborative.org/community-participation-measure/">expanded and documented here</a>.</li>
